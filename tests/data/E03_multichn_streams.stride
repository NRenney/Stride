# This line is correct as DummyOut should be auto-declared stereo
Oscillator(freq: 440) >> Pan(position: PanMod) >> DummyOut;

# This line should throw an error (Pan has two outputs)
Oscillator(freq: 440) >> Pan(position: PanMod) >> DummyOut2;

# This line should throw an error, output of Pan should provide 4 channels
DummyStereo >> Pan(position: PanMod) >> DummyStereo2;

# This line should work (Pan is expanded to two copies)
