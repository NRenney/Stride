Oscillator(freq: 5) >> Map(minimum: -1 maximum: 1) >> PanMod;

Oscillator(freq: 440) >> Pan(position: PanMod) >> AudioOut;

# This line is correct as DummyOut should be auto-declared stereo
Oscillator(freq: 440) >> Pan(position: PanMod) >> DummyOut;

# This line should throw an error (Pan has one input)
Oscillator(freq: 440) >> Pan(position: PanMod) >> DummyOut2;

# This line should throw an error, output of Pan should provide 4 channels
DummyStereo >> Pan(position: PanMod) >> DummyStereo2;

# This line should work (Pan is expanded to two copies)
DummyStereo >> Pan(position: PanMod) >> DummyQuad;

# Need to test platform functions as well as library functions
